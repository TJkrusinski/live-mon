## Live Stream Monitoring

Shows you things about a live stream. Docs and anything to make this at all appealing to come.

## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 6 and an npm version >= 3.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies.
**ProTip**: Install with [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for faster and safer installation

```bash
$ cd your-project-name && npm install
```

:bulb: *In order to remove boilerplate sample code, simply run `npm run cleanup`. After this is run, the initial sample boilerplate code will be removed in order for a clean project for starting custom dev*

## Run

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

*See [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug) for more information.*

#### DevTools extension

This boilerplate is included following DevTools extensions:

* [Devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) - Install via [electron-debug](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug).
* [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).
* [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - Install via [electron-devtools-installer](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

You can find the tabs on Chrome DevTools.

If you want to update extensions version, please set `UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS` env, just run:

```bash
$ UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 npm run dev

# For Windows
$ set UPGRADE_EXTENSIONS=1 && npm run dev
```



## CSS Modules

This boilerplate out of the box is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`

If you want to import global css libraries (like `bootstrap`), you can just write the following code in `.global.css`:

```css
@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
```


## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

## Further commands

To run the application without packaging run

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```
